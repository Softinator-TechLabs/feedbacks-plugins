# Third-party notices and provenance

Feedbacks' own source is covered by `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`. Dependencies retain their original copyrights, licenses and notices in their installed packages; the lockfile records exact resolved versions. A source release includes the lockfile; the runtime container preserves production packages and their notices.

The principal runtime packages are React/React DOM, React Markdown (MIT), Express, pg, Zod, Argon2, Sharp, tldts, the AWS SDK and the Model Context Protocol SDK. Development tools include TypeScript, Vite, tsx, Prettier, PGlite and Playwright (Apache-2.0). Native dependencies such as libvips have their own notices in the relevant packages. Use `npm sbom --sbom-format cyclonedx` after `npm ci` for the installed dependency inventory; this does not replace reviewing license text.

The public documentation build uses VitePress (MIT) and its local search. VitePress and its build dependencies are installed only while building the static website. The static output includes VitePress client assets and self-hosted font files; their package licenses remain in the npm dependency tree. The S3 request presigner is part of the AWS SDK family and runs only on the application server.

Existing reference research is recorded in [reference provenance](docs/reference-provenance.md). It records inspected examples, not a claim of copied code or permission to reuse proprietary features. New source reuse requires its exact origin, revision, license and required notices here.

The extension icons are the project's own Feedbacks mark. The public website uses self-hosted Manrope under SIL OFL 1.1 and an image generated for a fictional webpage. Font license text is retained in `site/public/fonts/OFL-Manrope.txt`; [website asset provenance](docs/website-assets.md) records sources and the image prompt. No customer logos or production screenshots are included.

The extension contains packaged project scripts and the pinned rrweb recorder and replay bundles; it does not bundle the server's npm dependencies. Its ZIP includes these project-wide notices; the referenced provenance document is also available in the [public source repository](https://github.com/Softinator-TechLabs/feedbacks-oss/blob/HEAD/docs/reference-provenance.md).

The Codex plugin build bundles its MCP adapter dependencies and copies their full license/notice files into `licenses/`. Its `BUILD.json` records the bundled inputs, package versions and license paths.

## rrweb session replay

`@rrweb/record` and `@rrweb/replay` 2.1.6 are bundled locally for recording and playback. Source: https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb. OpenReplay Spot was inspected as a reference; no Spot or player source is copied. Published rrweb bundles include their internal dependencies; their retained distribution notices are preserved in generated bundles. The upstream rrweb license is reproduced here:

## WebM duration metadata

`@fix-webm-duration/fix` and `@fix-webm-duration/parser` 1.0.1 are bundled locally in the extension to repair duration metadata in native and edited MediaRecorder output. Source: https://github.com/yusitnikov/fix-webm-duration, license retrieved from tag `v1.0.1`. The package license is reproduced below. The bundle also uses `tslib` 2.8.1 under the 0BSD license.

## FFmpeg server executable

The application container includes the Debian FFmpeg package and its runtime dependencies as separate executables for video previews, with DejaVu fonts for labels. Upstream: https://ffmpeg.org/ and https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/. Package license/copyright notices are retained under `/usr/share/doc` in the container; the installed Debian build determines applicable FFmpeg LGPL/GPL terms. These binaries are not bundled into the Chrome extension, static website or MCP client plugin. Distribution of container images must preserve the package notices and applicable corresponding-source obligations; source packages are available from Debian's package archives.
